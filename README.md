    Familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for development)
    A Kindle device or account to import notes from

    Implement a system for uploading and storing book metadata (e.g., title, author, cover art)
    Develop a robust notes system that allows users to add, edit, and delete notes for each book
     

Technical Requirements: 

    Front-end development using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
    Back-end development using Node.js or similar technology (optional)
    Database management using a tool like MongoDB or PostgreSQL (optional)
